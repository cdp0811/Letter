          <p class="cursive address">Dear Willard Second Floor Ladies&rsquo; Room,</p>
          <p class="body">I was recently asked what love means to me. One of the first words that came to mind was sacrifice, and truth be told, I have sacrificed a lot for you: wearing shoes at all times in case there is a giant puddle on your floor, keeping said shoes on in the shower and breathing through my mouth as soon as I open your door because you smell like feces covered in wing sauce.</p>
          <p class="body">Regardless, I have learned that there is no better place to learn about the really weird habits of humankind than within your walls. This includes myself &ndash; apparently I&rsquo;m the only one that does ballet barre workouts while brushing my teeth. Thanks for never judging me. Our relationship, unfortunately, was ill-fated from the start, and I will be leaving you soon. Please say you&rsquo;ll never forget me, as I know I&rsquo;ll never forget you &ndash; my first college bathroom.</p>

          Dear Alessandra Ignacio;
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          I want you to know that you are constantly on my mind, and I miss you more than words can express. It's difficult to go about my day without thinking of you and all the memories we created together. From our long talks to our silly jokes, every moment with you was special.
          <br>
          <br>
          I understand how hard it can be to be apart, but please know that distance does not change how I feel about you.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the meantime, I will be counting down the days until we can be together again. I look forward to the day when I can hold you in my arms
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Your bb,
          <br>
          Christian
